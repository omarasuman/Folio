Projects
Smart Building Health Monitor
Description: The Smart Building Health Monitor is a sophisticated system that collects data from various IoT devices within a building, including temperature readings, smoke detection signals, and door open/close status. It analyzes this data to detect anomalies and sends alerts to relevant authorities through Email or SMS when anomalies are detected. Additionally, it features a web-based dashboard for real-time status monitoring across all buildings.
Technologies: Python, Flask, Marshmallow, Terraform, AWS
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Boto3, Plotly/Dash, Twilio
Data Analytics Dashboard for Customer Insights
Description: This project showcases my expertise in building a web-based data analytics dashboard for customers to gain insights into their data. It involves collecting, processing, and analyzing data, presenting it through interactive visualizations, and utilizing machine learning for predictive analytics. It offers customer-centric features, feedback mechanisms, support, documentation, and user guides.
Technologies: Python, Flask, Machine Learning, AWS
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly/Dash
AI-Enhanced Recipe Recommendation Platform
Description: The AI-Enhanced Recipe Recommendation Platform is a web application that harnesses the power of artificial intelligence and data to provide personalized recipe recommendations to users. It incorporates data processing, recommendation algorithms, dynamic visualizations, and cloud-based computing. Additionally, it uses AI chatbots and cloud scalability to create a customer-centric experience, helping users discover and enjoy cooking.
